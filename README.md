# GameBoyNano
A GameBoy Audio Emulator for Arduino
THIS IS A WIP, it is unfinished, messy code, and un-optimized. It does compile right now, and plays a note on Channels 1-3

It will aim to simulate the GameBoy's Audio system, so that chiptune players can be made.
Compiles in Arduino IDE 1.8.0 Works on the Arduino Nano
Pin #3 gives the audio output with PWM.

I need to figure out timing in relation to frequency output
