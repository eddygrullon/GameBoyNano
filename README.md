# GameBoyNano
A GameBoy Audio Emulator for Arduino
THIS IS A WIP, it is unfinished, messy code, and un-optimized.
It currently plays a song through channels 1-3. The song code is not finished.

It will aim to simulate the GameBoy's Audio system, so that chiptune players can be made.
Compiles in Arduino IDE 1.8.0 Works on the Arduino Nano
Pin #3 gives the audio output with PWM.
